## Features
### Mechanics and code that I worked on:
- Creating the UI, main and pause menu settings
- Enemies: made an AI with roam and chase states and set up their animations. The enemies drop items that are randomly generated.
- Inventory: created an inventory system and menu to store picked up items. Items have descriptions. Some are edible and restore the player's health.
- NPC dialogue: created a dialogue system through Ink with dialogue options and branches. NPCs will explore the game's lore and give you quests. The dialogue updates when you complete certain tasks.
- Quests: made a quest system and menu to store active quests. The quest menu shows you descriptions of what items to find or monsters to kill. It updates depending on your current inventory. NPCs will reward you when you finish quests.
